# Using Semantic Kernel for AI Agents

## 20250709

A few days agao I was contacted by a business owner who is starting an AI agent-powered company. They asked if I was interested even though they don't have anything ready or available right now as they are still raising funds.

I thought this was yet another reason to finally get into actually working with AI Agents.

I use a lot of pre-made AI and have been following genAI for a while. I use Claude.ai fairly regularly for basic knowledge checks, have tried no-code platforms for app development, interact frequeintly with conversational AI, and have spent a lot of time dealing with Stable-Diffusion type image generation with Flux and ComfyUI.

I was attending a Tines presentation (it's actually still going on as I type this) and decided to take a look at a few frameworks to see where I can start.
